#FEWD Week #8: Forms & Bootstrap

---


###Description 

This week, you'll be practicing your form & bootstrap skills.  The homework assignment is to build a contact-us for using bootstrap.  

<br>

---


###Real-World Applications

- Be able to apply the proper HTML and CSS styles to create a modern web form
- Revisit applications and projects to iterate on code you've written 


<br>

---


###Technical Requirements 

- Use both input and textarea inputs.  Include properly linked <labels>.  Ensure that the placeholder attribute is populated as well.
- Build form using the Bootstrap3 framework and as many of the bootstrap styles as possible.
- Use the bootstrap grid to display both the contact form and contact information
- Use the <address> tag, <abbr> tag correctly for the contact information.  Bonus: implement an <a> tag with the phone number to allow mobile users to dial simply by clicking.
- Use the bootstrap grid structure correctly - no more than ONE parent #container / #container fluid and all children follow the pattern row -> columns



---

### Bonus

Use javascript to 'validate' the form input.  Validation is checking whether the user has typed in all the relevant information into required fields.

- email address should have an @ symbol and at least one . after the @ symbol
- subject and message should not be blank

Use jQuery to show a bootstrap alert element and/or color the required form fields.  Hint: there are already bootstrap classes and or html snippets in the Bootstrap3 manual that can display alerts!
