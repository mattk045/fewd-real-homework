			<p class = "Middle_Text">The concept of <span>natural patterns
			</span> links three of my main interests: philosophy, rock climbing, and computer programming or software engineering. </p>

			<p class = "Middle_Text">One similarity is that <span>in each discipline, there is often a natural way through a problem.</span> This way can be novel, unexpected, and even controversial; but the common examples always combine elegance and effectiveness.</p>

			<p class = "Middle_Text">I studied philosophy as an undergraduate, continuing through graduate school (in Scotland and at Notre Dame), then going back to the United Kingdom for four years as a member of the philosophy faculty at the University of Nottingham.</p>

			<p class = "Middle_Text">After returning to the States, I became interested in rock climbing through films like <span>180 South</span> and <span>To the Limit</span>. However, it was a couple of years before I actually went to a climbing center -- <span>EarthTreks</span> -- in late 2014. Since then I have been back almost every weekend and frequently during the week as well.</p>

			<p class = "Middle_Text">My interest in programming is somewhat similar, in that I've had this interest for several years, without successfully pursuing and developing it. But after reading an interesting book in fall 2015 -- John Kotter's <span>Leading Change </span> -- I am pursuing programming with more urgency, and with a better understanding of the process, and the possibilities.</p>
